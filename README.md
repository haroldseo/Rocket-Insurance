# Rocket Insurance

As interplanetary travel becomes mainstream, we're excited to offer rocket owners comprehensive coverage options to let them fly through space worry-free.

## How It Works

An application that takes in user inputs and provides an insurance quote. First, the user will have to fill out a form with name and address. Upon submitting the form, the user will be taken to a different page that displays their insurance quote, including the current annual premium. The user will be provided with two dropdown menus, one for deductibles and one for asteroid collision, and will have the option to update their annual premium by changing the values of the dropdown menus.
